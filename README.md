# Weather-Forecast

This project is a React application designed to provide real-time weather forecasts based on user-inputted city names. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, it retrieves current weather data such as temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather conditions. The user interface includes a search form where users can enter a city name, triggering a fetch request to the API. During data retrieval, a loading animation is displayed to indicate ongoing processing. If the city is found, detailed weather information is displayed including the city name, country code, temperature in Celsius, weather icon, and description. In cases where the city is not found or an error occurs, appropriate feedback is provided to the user. This application enhances user experience by presenting weather data in a clear and accessible manner, aiding in quick decision-making based on current weather conditions.
